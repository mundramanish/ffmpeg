0
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,660
I'd go to the moon just
to get close to you

1
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,800
But sitting in your room I
feel so far far far away

2
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,540
You know what to do to
pull me into you

3
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,160
Cuz every time you move you take
my breath breath breath away

4
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,850
When I hear you

5
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,660
Suddenly off my feet

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,140
So baby come through, I'll
play you on repeat

7
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,600
You're singing a sad song, but
you make it sound happy

8
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,460
You got the perfect words to
hurt me so hurt me so good

9
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,320
You're singing a sad song, but
you make it sound happy

10
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,830
You're playing my heart
& I'm falling apart

11
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,720
Just like I knew I would

12
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,760
Tell me why I save every
last dance for you

13
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,300
And everything you say I
memori-i-i-ize it all

14
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,040
You know how to get me higher

15
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,130
Even when I wanna cry

16
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,920
But you're setting me on fire
just to wa-wa-warm you up

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,440
When I hear you

18
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,380
Suddenly off my feet

19
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,760
So baby come through, I'll
play you on repeat

20
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,240
You're singing a sad song, but
you make it sound happy

21
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,100
You got the perfect words to
hurt me so hurt me so good

22
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,860
You're singing a sad song, but
you make it sound happy

23
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,460
You're playing my heart
& I'm falling apart

24
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,580
Just like I knew I would

25
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,560
Hear you deep inside of me

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,480
Your back and forth is
slowly ******* me

27
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,220
Don't just leave me quietly

28
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,420
Play your song and keep convincing me

29
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,480
You're singing a sad song, but
you make it sound happy

30
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,450
You got the perfect words to
hurt me so hurt me so good

31
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,300
You're singing a sad song, but
you make it sound happy

32
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,790
You're playing my heart
& I'm falling apart

33
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,820
Just like I knew I would
